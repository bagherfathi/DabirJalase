# Meeting Transcriber

High-level architecture for a cross-platform (Windows/macOS/Linux, optional Android thin client) meeting assistant with Farsi-first speech-to-text, text-to-speech, speaker identification, silence-triggered capture, and automated summaries governed by measurable quality gates plus smoke-test fixtures, privacy safeguards (consent + retention + audit logging), operational observability, offline resilience tiers, detailed data/packaging/recovery plans, hardened configuration/secret handling, and RTL-first accessibility validation.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the proposed system design, technology choices, and implementation steps.
