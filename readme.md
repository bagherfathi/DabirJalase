# Meeting Transcriber

High-level architecture for a cross-platform (Windows/macOS/Linux, optional Android thin client) meeting assistant with Farsi-first speech-to-text, text-to-speech, speaker identification, silence-triggered capture, and automated summaries governed by measurable quality gates plus smoke-test fixtures, privacy safeguards (consent + retention + audit logging), operational observability, network/media hardening, governance/compliance controls, offline resilience tiers, detailed data/packaging/recovery plans, hardened configuration/secret handling, release-gated testing, RTL-first accessibility validation, deployable desktop/server bundles with deterministic model delivery, a threat/abuse playbook, phased delivery roadmap, newly documented SLOs/migrations/rollback/backfill guidance, manual QA checklists, high-risk defenses, supply-chain/provenance/licensing safeguards, performance engineering and hardware sizing playbooks, prompt-safety/red-team guidance, dataset governance with continuous evaluation, capacity planning and cost controls, role-based onboarding/help, enterprise controls, chaos/incident readiness drills, in-app feedback/support loops, an end-to-end test matrix with traceability, change-control/hotfix workflows, post-release monitoring/ELS guardrails, vulnerability response, compatibility/migration policies, release communication controls, operational dashboards + SOP/runbook templates, a data lifecycle playbook, and a PR-by-PR execution plan for shipping the product.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the proposed system design, technology choices, PR-by-PR execution plan, acceptance criteria/checklist for each increment, the production readiness + Definition of Done gates for release, and the Product Build Blueprint (repo layout, MVP slice, CI commands, and exit criteria) to take this into a shipped product.

The initial scaffolds for that blueprint now live in `desktop-app/` (JavaFX shell) and `python_services/` (service-side stubs exposing deterministic REST endpoints, runnable with `python -m python_services`). The Python services include a lightweight session orchestrator that stitches STT/diarization/summarization together, captures speaker labels for "who is this?" prompts, and exports meeting manifests (segments + summary) for download or persistence until the production pipeline is wired. Requests carry request identifiers by default, can be API-key protected, export manifests can be written to disk, and a retention sweeper (configurable via env or API) keeps persisted artifacts bounded so the scaffold can sit safely behind gateways while full authN/Z lands. Dockerized runners and deterministic CLI harnesses (`python -m python_services.scripts.demo_session` for the demo flow, `python -m python_services.ops.smoke` for an API smoke) make it easy to exercise the scaffold end-to-end without local Python tooling.
