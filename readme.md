# Meeting Transcriber

High-level architecture for a cross-platform (Windows/macOS/Linux, optional Android thin client) meeting assistant with Farsi-first speech-to-text, text-to-speech, speaker identification, silence-triggered capture, and automated summaries governed by measurable quality gates plus smoke-test fixtures, privacy safeguards (consent + retention + audit logging), operational observability, network/media hardening, governance/compliance controls, offline resilience tiers, detailed data/packaging/recovery plans, hardened configuration/secret handling, release-gated testing, RTL-first accessibility validation, deployable desktop/server bundles with deterministic model delivery, a threat/abuse playbook, phased delivery roadmap, newly documented SLOs/migrations/rollback/backfill guidance, manual QA checklists, high-risk defenses, supply-chain/licensing protections, performance engineering playbooks, prompt-safety/red-team guidance, dataset governance, enterprise controls, and expanded supportability/roadmap details.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the proposed system design, technology choices, and implementation steps.
